## Do Hooks work with static typing?

Hooks were designed with static typing in mind. Because they’re functions, they are easier to type correctly than patterns like higher-order components. The latest Flow and TypeScript React definitions include support for React Hooks.

## What do Hooks mean for popular APIs like Redux connect() and React Router?

You can continue to use the exact same APIs as you always have; they’ll continue to work.

In the future, new versions of these libraries might also export custom Hooks such as useRedux() or useRouter() that let you use the same features without needing wrapper components.
