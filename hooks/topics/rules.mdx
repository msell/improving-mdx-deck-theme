export default SectionInverted

## Only Call Hooks at the Top Level

<div style={{ maxWidth: '800px', textAlign: 'left', color: '#fff' }}>
  Donâ€™t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead,
  always use Hooks at the top level of your React function. By following this
  rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component
  renders.
</div>
